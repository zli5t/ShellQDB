INTRODUCTION
ShellQDB is, as the name says, a quote database (for IRC channels and the like)
coded in shell scripts for flexibility and extensibility. It's currently under
active development. It started when the folks at #pctyd wanted a qdb and lietk12
and I both despised rash and other such systems. So we coded this! Enjoy!
A similar project with similar methods can be found at:
http://scalar.cluenet.org/~fastlizard4/quotes.php
(Except, use ours because we're more awesome, of course! :-P)

DOCUMENTATION
Extensive documentation can be found in the various scripts.  Miscellaneous
documentation not found elsewhere is provided below:

SAMPLE USAGE

searching for a quote with a specific keyword/regex
grep/sed for your quote here | outq/html

retreiving a specified quote (in this case, quote with id of 42)
egrep '^42::' | outq/html

retreiving a specified range of quotes (in this case, from quote 2 to quote 5)
sed -n '2,5p' | outq/html
or
sed -n '/^2::/,/^5::/p' | outq/html 
The latter doesn't depend on line number being equal to quote id, so it's more
forwards-compatible to changes in the program.

editing quotes
. lockq
awk -F:: 'if blah{do blah;print;}' <quotes >quotes.temp
mv quotes.temp quotes
. ulockq

this readme will be changed as development progresses. Remember to comment
what your scary sed strings mean! or at least what your programs do. :-)



NOTES ON FILES
lockq (lock quote) and unlockq (unlock quote): provide a layer of protection for
any operation dealing with the quote file, to ensure that no data's overwritten.

outq (output quote): a directory of formatters for various formats (html, etc.)

test: nothing to see here, move along.  It's not a coincidence that the contents
of this file are in quote #5.  *cough* cat test | escq | addq *cough*
