ShellQDB is, as the name says, a quote database (for IRC channels and the like)
coded entirely in shell scripts for flexibility and extensibility. Its currently under
active development. It started when the folks at #pctyd wanted a qdb and lietk12
and I both despised rash and other such systems. So we coded this! Enjoy!
A similar project with similar methods can be found at http://scalar.cluenet.org/~fastlizard4/quotes.php
(Except, use ours because we're more awesome, of course! :-P)

SAMPLE USAGE
adding a quote
echo "My quote here!" | escq | addq

searching for a quote with a specific keyword/regex
grep/sed for your quote here | outq/html

retreiving a specified quote (in this case, quote with id of 42)
egrep '^42::' | outq/html

retreiving a specified range of quotes (in this case, from quote 2 to quote 5)
sed -n '2,5p' | outq/html
or
sed -n '/^2::/,/^5::/p' | outq/html 
The latter doesn't depend on line number being equal to quote id, so it's more portable to changes in the program.

editing quotes
. lockq
awk -F:: 'if blah{do blah;print;}' <quotes >quotes.temp
mv quotes.temp quotes
. ulockq

this readme will be changed as development progresses. Remember to comment
what your scary sed strings mean! or at least what your programs do. :-)



NOTES ON FILES
escq (escape quote): sanitize the input and convert it into one-line form.
unescq (unescape quote): convert the input into its literal form, with multi-lines and such.

addq (add quote): add the input to the quote file.

lockq (lock quote) and unlockq (unlock quote): provide a layer of protection for any operation dealing with the quote file, to ensure that no data is lost or overwritten.

outq (output quote): a directory of formatters for various formats (html, etc.)

setqf (set quote flag): set the third flag in the quote file.  This flag can have any value, but it is meant for 3 possible values:
u (unapproved): quotes that have just been submitted; they will not be visible anywhere until an admin changes the flag to a.  Admins can essentially approve a quote (with a) or unapprove it (with h).
a (approved): normal quotes; they will be shown.
h (hidden): quotes that have been deleted; they will not be visible anywhere.  Deleted quotes will always exist, so every quote ever will have a unique index number.
usage: setqf [quote id] [flag]

setqscore (set quote score): modify a quote's score/rating/quality/etc.  Accepts 3 arguments:
up: increment the score by one.
down: decrement the score by one.
(any numerical argument): set the score to the value provided.
usage: setqscore [quote id] [option]

test: nothing to see here, move along.  It's not a coincidence that the contents of this are in quote #5.  *cough* cat test | escq | addq *cough*
