ShellQDB is, as the name says, a quote database (for IRC channels and the like)
coded entirely in shell for flexibility and extensibility. Its currently under
active development. It started when the folks at #pctyd wanted a qdb and lietk12
and I both despised rash and other such systems. So we coded this! Enjoy!

adding quotes:
echo "My quote here!" | escq | addq

showing quotes
grep/sed for your quote here | fmtq

changing quotes
. lockq
awk -F:: 'if blah{do blah;print;}' <quotes >quotes.temp
mv quotes.temp quotes
. ulockq

this readme will be changed as development progresses. Remember to comment
what your scary sed strings mean! or at least what your programs do. :-)
