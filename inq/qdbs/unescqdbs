# NOTES
# unescqdbs (unescape quote): convert the QdbS sanitized quotes (from a QdbS
# type database, then output it to standard output.  Accepts one argument (the
# sanitized body of the quote), but you should use this with pipes
# (see USAGE->Example(s)).
# Meant to be used where the output is piped from retrieval of some part of the
# contents of the quotes file (see USAGE of addq)
#
