# NOTES
# unescqdbs (unescape quote): convert the rqms sanitized quotes (from a rqms
# type database), then output it to standard output.  Accepts one argument (the
# sanitized body of the quote), but you should use this with pipes
# (see USAGE->Example(s)).
# Meant to be used where the output is piped from retrieval of some part of the
# contents of the quotes file (see USAGE of addq)
#
# USAGE
# unescrqms [sanitized form of quote]
# Example(s):
# Works just like unescq, but replaces different things.

# Replace '&amp;' with '&'
s_&amp;_\&_g
# Replace "&quot;" with '"' (a double quote)
s_&quot;_\"_g
# Replace "&#039;" with "'" (a single quote)
s_&#039;_\'_g
# Replace '&lt;' with '<'
s_&lt;_\<_g
# Replace '&gt;' with '>'
s_&gt;_\>_g
# Replace '&nbsp;' with ' ' (a space)
s_&nbsp;_\ _g
