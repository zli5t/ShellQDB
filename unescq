# NOTES
# unescq (unescape quote): convert previously sanitized input into literal form,
# then output it to standard output.  Accepts one argument (the sanitized body
# of the quote), but you should use this with pipes (see USAGE->Example(s)).
# Meant to be used where the output is piped from retrieval of some part of the
# contents of the quotes file (see USAGE of addq)
#
# USAGE
# unescq [sanitized form of quote]
# Example(s):
# echo "<lietk12> so this guy says "foo\\nbar"\n<skr> foobar" | escq
#  Comment: The two above lines are one command.  The output of this command is:
#   <lietk12> so this guy says "foo\nbar"
#   <skr> foobar
#  Obviously, this should be piped into addq (see the USAGE of addq)
# cat thisFileContainsOneQuote | escq
#  Comment: the output of this command is:
#   <lietk12> so this guy says "foo\\nbar"\n<skr> foobar
#  The command "cat thisFileContainsOneQuote" returns:
#   <lietk12> so this guy says "foo\nbar"
#   <skr> foobar

# Replace "\\n" with "\n"

# Replace "\\:" with ":"

# Replace "\\\\" with "\\"
