# NOTES
# unescq (unescape quote): convert previously sanitized input into literal form,
# then output it to standard output.  Accepts one argument (the sanitized body
# of the quote), but you should use this with pipes (see USAGE->Example(s)).
# Meant to be used where the output is piped from retrieval of some part of the
# contents of the quotes file (see USAGE of addq)
#
# USAGE
# echo '[sanitized form of quote]' | unescq
# cat [file with sanitized form of quote] | unescq

# Replace "\\n" with "\n"
s_[^\]\\n_\n_g
# Replace "\\:" with ":"
s_\\:_:_g
# Replace "\\\\" with "\\"
s_\\\\_\\_g
